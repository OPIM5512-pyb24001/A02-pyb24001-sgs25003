## Project Overview
This project trains a simple neural network regression model (MLPRegressor) on the California Housing dataset using scikit-learn.

The goal is to practice GitHub collaboration using branches, pull requests, reviews, and merges while building a small data science pipeline.

---

## What the code does
- Load the California Housing dataset
- Split data into training and test sets
- Train an MLPRegressor with early stopping
- Generate actual vs predicted plots for training and test data
