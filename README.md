Partners:
- pyb24001
- sgs25003

## Project Overview
This project trains a simple neural network regression model
(MLPRegressor) on the California Housing dataset using scikit-learn.

The goal is to practice GitHub collaboration using branches,
pull requests, and reviews while building a small data science pipeline.

## What the code does
- Load the California Housing dataset
- Split data into training and test sets
- Train an MLPRegressor with early stopping
- Generate actual vs predicted plots for train and test data

## How to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/ds_pipeline.py
